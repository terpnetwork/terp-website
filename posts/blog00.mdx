# Introducing Terp Network

The cannabis community is built on the principles of decentralization and diversity, where people from all walks of life can come together, learn from each other, and build lifelong connections. However, these values are being threatened, and it's important that we educate and raise awareness about the tools available to combat censorship.

That's where Terp Network comes in. We believe that blockchain technology and self-sovereignty can help ensure a fair and transparent cannabis industry.

## Industry Concerns

Our goal is to support growth, sustainability, and innovation in the cannabis market through verifiable software that is accessable to everyone. We know that there's a need for better tools and resources, and Terp Network is here to fill that gap.

## Mission Statement

At Terp Network, it mission is simple: to build a strong, supportive community that contributes to the success and sustainability of the cannabis industry through verifiable, decentralized, open source, permissionless, & censorship resistance software & education. We believe that by cooporating within a growing ecosystem, we can make a positive impact on this industry and the people it serves, which roots many other cultures both alike and independent from each other.


##  What is Terp Network?

TERPNET is a **decentralized platform** owned by & for the cannabis community, to build applications ontop of and learn about the benefits of self-sovereign De-Fi tooling, in an hyperfocused ecosystem for our community. 


Powered by [CometBFT](https://tendermint.com/), [CosmosSDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/), & [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), Terp Network is a verifiable interface for teams to create solutions for specific problems in the cannabis industry, utilizing the credibility & censorship resistance features offered by smart contracts and accuracy blockchains manifest.

## Use Cases 

- ### Smart Contracts 
With TERPNET, users can develop and deploy customized applications to meet their specific needs in a secure and fast Proof-of-Stake network. Smart contracts are logic that can be designed for very useful implementations.

- ### Governance 
Governance on Terp Network is achieved through formal voting. This allows the community to make decisions and shape the direction of the platform, both on and off-chain. Decisions can be made through text-based proposals, protocol parameter changes, and binary upgrades.


*What kind of changes are made via on-chain governance with Terp-Net?* 

    - Text Based Proposals 
    - Protocol Parameter Changers 
    - Binary Upgrades

###  Interoperability

Terp Network is built with IBC (Interblockchain-Communication) functionalities, meaning that users interacting with terp network are directly exposed to functions & use cases of a large majority of projects within the interchain including Ethereum, Polygon, Osmosis, Crypto.com , Juno, Axelar, Secret , and dozens others. **

This is an exciting feature as **current projects focused on cannabis culture & the Decentralized-Web adoption are already interoperable with terp network.** If you are interested in providing real utility for your project, [**join our discord**](https://discord.gg/SYEjMwAac7) to find active community members!
